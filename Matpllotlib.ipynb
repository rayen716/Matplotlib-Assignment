    "Ans1. Matplotlib is a Python data visualization library used to create a wide range of 2D and 3D visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and more. It was created by John D. Hunter in 2003 as a way to visualize data in Python using a syntax similar to that of MATLAB. Matplotlib is an open-source library that is actively maintained and has a large community of users and contributors.\n",

    "Here are five types of plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib:\n",
    "\n",
    "Line plot - Used to show trends or patterns in data over time, such as stock prices or temperature changes.\n",
    "Scatter plot - Used to show the relationship between two variables, such as height and weight or income and education level.\n",
    "Bar plot - Used to compare different categories or groups of data, such as sales by region or votes by party.\n",
    "Histogram - Used to show the distribution of a numerical variable, such as test scores or ages.\n",
    "Pie chart - Used to show the proportion of each category in a dataset, such as the percentage of sales by product or the percentage of votes by candidate."
